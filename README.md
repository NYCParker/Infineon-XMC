> When I first learnd Infineon XMC to drive motors, there were relatively few demo programs and tutorials that I could learn. Now I am very glad to see the increasing use of Infineon MCUs in China.I hope to share the peripheral drivers of Infineon XMC series microcontrollers I debugged in keil and my learning experience.

>   当我初学Infineon XMC系列单片机进行电机控制时，相关的例程和学习资料相对较少，英飞凌这几年在国内的推广有目共睹，我希望能在github上分享我在keil里曾经调试过的一些外设驱动程序，并和大家一起讨论学习经验。
